Try doing this is DNS resolution is acting fucky on mac:
    - add <ip address><SPACE or TAB><domain with no www> to (CONSIDER ADDING .COM):
        * /etc/private/hosts
        * /etc/hosts
        * /etc/resolv.conf
    - Flush DNS cache with:
        * dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
    - Make sure you are not adding an additional "/" to the end of the
    URL you are searching for in your browser.
