Findings:
    - Contact Us page gives away that there is a delivery.htb email address possible. Perhaps a site with that domain as well?
    - MatterMost server for team-chat service is being used on the backend.
    - Ticketing system is OSTicket. Creating an account with a non-gmail email allowed us to bypass the verification. 
    - What to do next according to Ippsec: We need to look at our ticket, and see that anything sent to our generated email address (4964622@delivery.htb) will
    be sent to the ticket. We can then create an account with our generated corporate email on mattermost and then verify from the ticket dashboard. This will give us
    access to the matter most, where sensitive data is exposed.
