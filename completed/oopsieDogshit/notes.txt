Findings:
    - OS type Linux.
    HTB Sucks.
    - Used writeup to figure out that we were somehow supposed to use a password from a previous box that I did not do.
    - Then, we were to use burp to sniper an account id that works and then use that superuser to upload a reverse shell.
    - Then, we needed to privesc by looking in an obscure file in the var/www directory that has a password.
    - Then, we were supposed to use that user and see what group he was in. Then use a binary that only the group can use to
    see the contents of root.txt. We were supposed to use strings to see what the binary was doing.
